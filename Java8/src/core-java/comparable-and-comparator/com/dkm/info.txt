comparable and comprator are used for sorting collection of objects

- to apply sorting methods of arrays or collection on any user defined class, the class should implement the comparable interface

comparable:
--------------
- comparable interface has compareTo(T obj) method - must be overriden for sorting

1. we can sort the collection of object on the basic of a single element. say by id or by name, or by price

2. comparable affects the original class

3. CompareTo()


comparator:
------------
- comparator interface has compare(Object o1, Object o2) method - needs to implemented for sorting

1. we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple element such as id, name, price etc.

2. comparator doesn't affect the original class

3. compare()
