        <h2>About Katihar</h2>
        <div class="pic-info">
            <div>
                <p>Katihar became a full-fledged district when it was split from Purnia 
                    in 1973. Katihar  is a historical place and takes  place in Indian history.
                    It is said that Hindu Lord Shri  Krishna came here and lost mani here in Manihari 
                    (a religious place of Katihar district). Katihar was a part of Purnia
                    district and the latter was constituted in round about 1813 along 
                    with Malda district. In 1872 the district was transferred from the control of Bihar
                    and Banaras Board of Commissioners to the Calcutta Board of Revenue. Before the partition
                    of Bengal, Katihar was belonging to Bengal. But when the Partition divided Bengal into Bihar,
                    Bengal and Orrisa, today’s Katihar District came under Bihar. With the independence 
                    of India, the people of Katihar breathed free along with all the Indians. Katihar 
                    was a sub-divisional town of Purnea district but on 2nd October 1973, Katihar
                    acquired status of an independent district. It has a rich heritage and close linkage with the parent district of Purnia.
